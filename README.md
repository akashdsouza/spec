# Handlebars

This repository contains a work in progress draft of the Handlebars templating language specification.

## Developing the Specification

After cloning, run `npm install` to set up your environment.
In one shell, run `npm run ecmarkup -- --watch` to compile the spec whenever a source file changes.
In another shell, run `npm run server` to run an auto-reloading preview of the spec.
